Dynamic Report</font></span><br>
</font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Dynamic Report is a 
breakthrough programming application that provides a front-end function for your 
application. It is the only program that lets you generate query reports in HTML 
from your database and design your own report page. With Dynamic Report, you can 
easily build an interactive application or website and better communicate your 
trade.</font></span></h1>

<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Automatic code 
generation<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Using 
Dynamic Report is as easy as using WYSIWIG software. You don’t have to weave pa</font><font size="3"><b>ges
</b>of code to control the design – simply enter your preferences in the 
program’s form fields, and Dynamic Report will generate the code for you. This 
way, all you have to worry about is maintaining your database in the backend.</font></span></h1>
<h1><font color="#000080" size="4">
<span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Fully customizable<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-weight: 400"><font size="3">Dynamic 
Report gives you full control over your report’s design, from the title text to 
the object captions. Add in graphics such as your company logo, a background 
image, or page and table borders. You even have the option to show the grouping 
data, group navigator, and data summaries.</font></span></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><font color="#000080" size="4"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">Language 
support<br>
</span></font><span lang="EN-GB">Dynamic Report recognizes major Eastern 
languages, so your users can view their results in their native language. 
There’s no need to code in special characters, either – the program 
automatically adjusts the orientation and alignment to accommodate foreign type.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: underline">
<font color="#000080" size="4">Runs on any application<br>
</font></span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">You can 
easily integrate Dynamic Report into your project coding software. It works with 
all COM-based applications including Visual Basic, Visual basic C++, Delphi, and 
Borland C++. &nbsp;Even a fully customized report generator takes up only a few lines 
of code, unlike other add-ons which you have to code in at every page.</span></h1>

be an advanced programmer in order to install and fully use Dynamic Report. Its 
setup program automatically registers the Dc_DynamicReport10.dll file on your 
system. To integrate it into your project, simply select 'add reference' from 
the project menu.&nbsp; Click the 'browse' button to locate  your DC_DynamicReport35.dll file.</font></span></h1>
